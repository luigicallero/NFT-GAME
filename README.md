# NFT-Game
## The Board Game to play with NFTs

 We have built a online Board Game similar to Jumanji where you can pick any NFT from
the Gallery to be your player.

NFTs are initially minted with characteristics generated randomly by using Chainlink.

Currently for sale in OpenSea (testnet): https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/nft-manji-1

What you get by owning it? The right to play the NFT-Game.
